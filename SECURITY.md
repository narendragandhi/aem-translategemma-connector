# Security Guide for AEM TranslateGemma Connector

This document outlines security considerations and best practices for the AEM TranslateGemma Translation Connector.

## Security Overview

The connector integrates with Google Cloud Vertex AI API and requires proper security configurations to ensure safe operation.

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication and Credentials

✅ **Secure Implementation**
- Uses Google Cloud's built-in authentication mechanisms
- Supports Application Default Credentials (ADC)
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Service account-based authentication recommended

⚠️ **Configuration Requirements**
- Google Cloud credentials must be properly configured
- Service accounts should have minimum required permissions
- Credentials should be stored securely (not in configuration files)

### 2. Input Validation

✅ **Current Implementation**
- Input validation for language codes
- Length limits on translation requests
- Content type validation
- HTML content preservation
- **Input sanitization to prevent prompt injection (v1.2.0+)**
- **Language code format validation (v1.2.0+)**
- **Content category validation (v1.2.0+)**

🔧 **Recommendations**
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing (automatic in v1.2.0+)
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Monitor for unusual translation patterns
- Review audit logs regularly

### 3. Data Privacy

✅ **Data Handling**
- No local storage of sensitive content
- Temporary processing only
- No logging of translated content
- Uses HTTPS for all external communications

⚠️ **Considerations**
- Translated content is sent to Google Cloud services
- Review Google Cloud's privacy policy
- Consider content sensitivity requirements

### 4. Network Security

✅ **Implementation**
- HTTPS-only communication with Google Cloud
- Configurable timeouts for network calls
- Connection pooling for efficient resource use
- Circuit breaker for fault isolation (v1.2.0+)

### 5. Prompt Injection Protection (v1.2.0+)

The connector includes built-in protection against prompt injection attacks:

- **Input Sanitization**: All user input is sanitized before being used in prompts
- **Pattern Detection**: Detects and neutralizes common prompt injection patterns
- **Language Code Validation**: Validates language codes against ISO 639-1 format
- **Length Limits**: Enforces maximum input length (10,000 characters)

```java
// Automatic sanitization is applied to:
// - Source text for translation
// - Detected language text
// - Content categories
String safeInput = InputSanitizer.sanitizeForPrompt(userInput);
```

## Security Configuration

### Google Cloud Permissions

Required minimal permissions for service account:
```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/aiplatform.user",
      "members": ["serviceAccount:your-service-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### OSGi Configuration Security

1. **Project ID**: Non-sensitive project identifier
2. **Location**: Geographic region for Vertex AI
3. **Credentials**: Use Application Default Credentials
4. **Timeouts**: Configure reasonable limits

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Setup
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Enable Cloud Audit Logging
- Implement IP restrictions if possible
- Regularly rotate service account keys

### 2. Monitoring and Logging
```xml
<!-- Enable security logging -->
<Logger name="com.example.aem.translation" level="INFO"/>
<Logger name="com.google.cloud.vertexai" level="WARN"/>
```

### 3. Access Control
- Restrict who can configure the translation service
- Use AEM's built-in permission model
- Regularly review configuration changes

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR/Privacy
- Processed content leaves your infrastructure
- Google Cloud becomes a data processor
- Ensure appropriate data processing agreements

### Data Residency
- Vertex AI location affects data storage
- Choose regions compliant with your requirements
- Consider data sovereignty requirements

## Security Auditing

### Recommended Security Checks

1. **Quarterly Reviews**
   - Service account permissions audit
   - API usage monitoring
   - Configuration validation

2. **Incident Response**
   - Monitor for API quota exhaustion
   - Track failed authentication attempts
   - Log unusual translation patterns

### Security Monitoring Metrics

```java
// Example metrics to monitor
- Translation request rate per user
- Failed translation attempts
- Authentication failures
- API quota usage
- Content size distributions
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Third-Party Dependency**: Relies on Google Cloud security
2. **Network Exposure**: Requires outbound HTTPS connectivity
3. **Content Processing**: Content processed by external service

## Security Updates

- Regular dependency updates (Google Cloud SDK)
- Security patches for AEM components
- Monitor Google Cloud security advisories

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover security vulnerabilities, please report them:
1. Do not create public GitHub issues
2. Contact project maintainers privately
3. Provide detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for response
